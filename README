OpenVPN-Monitor is a simple python program to generate html to display the
status of an OpenVPN server, including all current connections. It uses the
openvpn management console. It typically runs on the same host as the openvpn
server, though does not necessarily need to.

Adding the following line to your openvpn connection will run the management
console on 127.0.0.1 port 5555:

   management 127.0.0.1 5555

For remote managment, refer to the openvpn man pages about how to secure access
to the management interface.

The example configuration file should give some indication of how to set site
name, add a logo, etc. You can also set the default location (latitude and
longitude) for google maps. If not set, it will default to Melbourne, Australia.

It can be run from the command line to test the html is generating correctly.

To run under apache, mod_python will probably need to be enabled using e.g.

   AddHandler cgi-script .py

and added to the virtualhost/directory you are using.
