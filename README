OpenVPN-Monitor is a simple python program to generate html to display the
status of an OpenVPN server, including all current connections. It uses the
openvpn management console. It typically runs on the same host as the openvpn
server.

Adding the following line to your openvpn connection will run the management
console on 127.0.0.1 port 5555:

   management 127.0.0.1 5557

The example configuration file should give some indication of how to set site
name, add a logo, etc.

It can be run from the command line to test the html is generating correctly.

To run under apache, mod_python will probably need to be enabled, and

   AddHandler cgi-script .py

added to the virtualhost you are using.
